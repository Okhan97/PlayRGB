## NOTES

So this is supposed to be the notes/thoughs that I made/think while programming.
--
Gotta learn how to use markdown ...

Ok, so, the firsts stepd must be:
1- How to get the RGB code of an image
2- How to modify images by pixel
3- How to read math writing in python

I will make a module for each of this ones
--
I will just make a dev branch and merge that to master... it's not like it really matters anyway, it's a one person project (?)
--
pip install Pillow
--
Looks like pypng will be my choice ... at least at first
--
I really don't know how long this project is going to take, the more I think about it the more I get new ideas
